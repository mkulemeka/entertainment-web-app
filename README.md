## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS modules
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwind CSS
- [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) - Authentication provider
- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) - Cloud storage
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - Routing


### What I learned

- How to work with firebase auth to provide authentication service
- How to work with React Router and authentication to secure protected routes.

### Continued development

- Planning on implementing a TMDb API to fetch shows
- Continued development to make it a fullstack application.

### Useful resources

- [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) - This helped me learn how to use Firebase's authentication service.
- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) - This helped me learn how to use Firebase's cloud storage. It allowed me to no longer local data in the app. Bookmarked data is no longer stored locally on the browser.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - Docs for React Router.
